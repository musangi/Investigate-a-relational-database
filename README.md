# Investigate-a-relational-database
The sakila movie database is a SQL database of online DVD rentals. You will query the database to answer the questions about business decisions
/* Udacity 1st project: Investigate a Relational Database */


/* Slide 1: How many movies were rented out in each family friendly category? */

/*Question 2:
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies
are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter,
third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories?
Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.*/



/* Slide 2: For each quartile, count how many times a film category was rented out? */

/* Question 3
Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of
movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:

Category
Rental length category
Count
*/






/* Slide 3:Who were our top paying customers and how much were their monthly payments? */
/*Question 2
We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis
during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments.Can you write a query to capture the
customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?
*/



/* Slide 4: For the top paying customers, what is the difference across their monthly payments? */

/*Question 3
Finally, for each of these top 10 paying customers, I would like to find out the difference across their monthly payments during 2007.
Please go ahead and write a query to compare the payment amounts in each successive month. Repeat this for each
of these 10 paying customers. Also, it will be tremendously helpful if you can identify the customer name who paid the most
difference in terms of payments.*/
